# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External
- Time
  > We have a lot to learn and a lot of work to accomplish for the website to
  > work.
- Availability
  > Sometimes we are not available at the same time, thus not everyone attend
  > the meeting.
- Things we don't control
  > Madhu is traveling to India. She might not be connected all the time.
  > Sickness: Headaches, tiredness. Josee is not connecting on the 07/04:
  > Commemoration of the Rwandan genocide
- Availability
  > Most of the people has everyday job and are available in the evening.
  > Availability is very important for the project to run. Availability for the
  > group meeting is essential
- Natural causes
  > Any external fact that migh happen that we don't have control on: Headaches,
  > Unplanned babysitting, sickness, accident, etc. All those can slow us down.
## Internal: Involuntary
- Technology
  > Computer slowing down or getting stuck. We do not master github and VSCode
  > perfectly yet, nor HTML and CSS.
- Issues
  > Issues might occur. Try to solve them as soon as possible by asking help and
  > getting it.
- Interface and/or OS
  > All members of our teams use different OS (Mac, Windows, Linux) making it
  > difficult to help sometimes.
- Troubleshooting
  > Issues we might encounter while working in the workflow due to missuses or
  > mistake of commands or workflow. Can be solved but we need to invest time to
  > investigate.
## Internal: Voluntary
- Communication
  > Depends on time and availability of the teammates and coaches.
- Dependency
  > We all depend of someone else to review our work. Hence we need to work on
  > our own part as soon as possible so we do not create delays for others.
- Work/life balance
  > We all have other matters to attend besides the project Making it difficult
  > to be available at all times.  
  > Since we all depend of someone else to review our work. We also require time
  > to discuss in group about what we need. That might complicate our efficiency
  > in time.
