## Deployment View

The deployment view takes into account the system's requirements such as system availability, reliability (fault tolerance), performance (throughput), and scalability. This view maps the various elements identified in the logical, process, and development views—networks, processes, tasks, and objects—onto the processing nodes.
The deployment diagram is used for modeling the static deployment view of a system.
The figure below depicts the deployment diagram for DApp system.

***Elements description***

#### Mobile Device
  - *Short Description:*
    - A DApp is an application that is mostly or entirely decentralized, Backend software (application logic), Frontend software, Data storage, Message communications, Name resolution
    - These applications  interact with blockchain. 
    - In the Ethereum ecosystem as it stands today, there are very few truly decentralized apps—most still rely on centralized services and servers for some part of their operation. 
  - *Relations:*
    - Backend (Smart Contract)
    - 
  - *Requirements:*
    - EVM and new languages such as Solidity, the client-side interface of a DApp can use standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.). 

#### Head Unit
  - *Short Description:*
  - The Auction DApp allows a user to register a "deed" token, which represents some unique asset, such as a house, a car, a trademark, etc.
    - This interface includes:
    - A set of presets
    - Media buttons (seek forward/backward, tune up/down, and play/pause)
    - Menu items
    - Graphic user interface
    - a token has been registered, the ownership of the token is transferred to the Auction DApp, 
  - The Auction DApp lists each of the registered tokens.
