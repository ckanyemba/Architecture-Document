##  Contraints


|Contraints|Description|
|---|---|
|Performance|The verification of data written into the database is accomplished by a consensus of participating nodes. By leveraging blockchain technology, HUMAN Protocol smart contracts ensure that tasks are served, completed, and compensated in a reliable and fair manner.|
|Time|Human Protocol transactions can be made across the globe, and will generally be executed within seconds at a fraction of the cost of an international wire transfer, and with reliable fidelity to the terms of the contract-- this ensures timely, reliable, global payments for work performed| 


  
 ## Constraints in Software Architecture

> * Technical constraints are fixed technical design decisions that absolutely cannot be changed. Most often technical constraints are provided by stakeholders (perhaps after some digging) at the outset of the project. Sometimes a team may choose to create a constraint, perhaps to simplify the world in which they are working. Regardless of the origin, these architecture drivers are technical in nature and are considered unchangeable and indeed very soon become so.


# There are many common examples of technical constraints that you've likely seen.

 > * ```Programming language - often times a specific programming language will be required for various reasons. For example, the customer may be a Javascript or Ruby or Solidity. You might simply prefer a certain language over another, or have specific expertise that dictates using a particular programming language. Nearly always, once you've picked a language you are stuck with that choice for the remainder of the project.```

 > * ```Operating system or platforms supported - It must work on Windows, or Linux, or iOS, or, or ... building software that does not satisfy the platform constraint means you have failed to design a software system that satisfies stakeholders' key concerns.```

 > * ```Use of a specific library or framework - Sometimes a specific library might be required to be used. The specific origin might come from the business but the influence is very technical. A common example at many companies is the use of specific open source libraries. Some companies might require that open source always be used. Other companies, might have an approved list indicating which open source software may be used. An interesting example at Blockchain using the ethereum network through integration is that we are required to target the "Blue" JVM, IBM's JDK for all JVM-based projects.```
